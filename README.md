# README

This repository contains the data and code needed to reproduce the analyses for 
the article "Editorial Governance Under Pressure: Wikipedia's Revert Dynamics 
During the 2024 US Election" by Giuliano Formisano, Emmie Hine, Prathm Juneja,
Joel Laitila, Claudio Novelli, Ethan Chiu, Elizabeth Dejanikus, Madeline Levin,
Andrew West, and Luciano Floridi.

## Data

The file `df_wikimedia_full_dataset.csv.zip` in the `data` folder contains the dataset needed to 
reproduce the analyses.

## Python Code

There are three Python scripts that produce the analyses in the main text and 
in the Supporting Information. To produce the figures, install Python 
version >= 3.9.13, install the packages in `requirements.txt`, and run 
the scripts:

`1-Time-series-analysis-editing.ipynb`
`2-Time-series-analysis-risk.ipynb`
`3-Time-series-analysis-change-detection.ipynb`

## Figures

The folder `figures` contains the figures produced by the Python scripts.
